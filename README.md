# Brain-tumor-model
Basic brain tumor classifying Vision Transformer model

# Info and purpose:
This is a basic model that I built to just showcase the skills I have on image classification and transformers,this model is able to detect brain tumour in 4 classifications: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary and No Tumour if nothing is detected to an accuracy of 94-95%.
